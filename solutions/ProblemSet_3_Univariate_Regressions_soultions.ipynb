    "\n",
    "## 5 pts per question, 10 points out of 90 in total with 10 bonus points. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Set 2 is designed to introduce students to the basics of regression analysis, a fundamental tool in data analytics and econometrics. By using the NLSY97 dataset, students will explore relationships between key variables such as education, gender, and hourly compensation. This problem set emphasizes practical experience with Python and the statsmodels library, reinforcing theoretical knowledge through hands-on data manipulation and analysis. By completing these exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of univariate regression techniques, preparing them for more advanced multivariate analyses and real-world applications in economics and business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instruction\n",
    "The dataset data NLSY97.xlsx, available on CANVAS, contains all necessary information. These data are sourced from\n",
    "the NLSY97, a representative national database of individuals born in the early 1980s in the United States. Below are some variables we will use:\n",
    "- educ: number of years of education completed\n",
    "- gender: denotes the gender of the individual\n",
    "- minority: 1 if the individual belongs to a minority group, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- mother_educ: 1 if the individualâ€™s mother has a college degree, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- annual_income: Annual income frome wages.\n",
    "- gpain8: GPA in 8th grade.\n",
    "- retention: 1 if the individual was required to repeat a grade during middle school, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow below questions and instructions to complete this problem set. In some questions, please write and execute Python code for data analysis in Cell mode. Comment your code to explain each step. Some questions need text discussion. Please Provide a detailed discussion of your results, including interpretations and answers to questions in Raw mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the assignment, save your Jupyter notebook with the following naming convention: ECN394_ProblemSetX_LastName_FirstName.ipynb (replace X with the assignment number)."
