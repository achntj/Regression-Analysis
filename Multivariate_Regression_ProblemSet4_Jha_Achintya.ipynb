    "# Problem Set 4: Multivariate Regressions \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary and Motivation\n",
    "Multivariate Regressions aims to deepen students' understanding of regression analysis by introducing them to multivariate techniques. Using the data_NLSY97v2 dataset, students will learn to code and interpret multivariate regression models in Python, focusing on relationships between variables such as education, ability, and wages. This problem set enhances analytical skills by requiring data cleaning, creation of new variables, and comprehensive interpretation of regression outputs. By completing these exercises, students will gain valuable experience in handling complex datasets and performing advanced statistical analyses, essential for real-world economic and business applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instruction\n",
    "The dataset data_NLSY97v2.xlsx, available on CANVAS, contains all the necessary information. These data are sourced from the NLSY97, a representative national database of individuals born in the early 1980s in the United States. Below are some variables we will use:\n",
    "- educ: number of years of education completed\n",
    "- Annual_Income: annual income that these individuals perceived when an adults\n",
    "- gender: denotes the gender of the individual\n",
    "- minority: 1 if the individual belongs to a minority group, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- m_degree_4: 1 if the individual’s mother has a college degree, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- family income: Annual family income when these individuals were teenagers, reported in thousands.\n",
    "- gpain8: GPA in 8th grade.\n",
    "- retention: 1 if the individual was required to repeat a grade during middle school, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the questions and instructions below to complete this problem set. For some questions, please write and execute Python code for data analysis in Cell mode. Comment your code to explain each step. Some questions need text discussion. Please provide a detailed discussion of your results, including interpretations and answers to questions in Raw mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the assignment, save your Jupyter notebook with the following naming convention: ECN310_ProblemSetX_LastName_FirstName.ipynb (replace X with the assignment number).\n",

This effect is not statistically significant for all values of alpha (since p = 0.052).\n",

This is statistically significant (for most values of alpha), showing a strong association between education level and income.\n",
