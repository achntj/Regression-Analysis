    "# Problem Set 5: Multivariate Regressions 2: Categorical Variables and Interaction Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary and Motivation\n",
    "This problem sets continues practing with multiariate regressions. And it focuses on enhancing students' understanding of multivariate regression by incorporating categorical variables, dummy variables, and interaction terms. Using the NLSY97 dataset, students will learn to handle complex data structures and interpret the impacts of categorical variables and their interactions on dependent variables. This problem set aims to provide practical experience in Python, reinforcing the theoretical concepts learned in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "The dataset, data_NLSY97v2, are sourced from the NLSY97, a representative national database of individuals born in the early 1980s in the United States. Below are some variables we will use:\n",
    "- educ: number of years of education completed\n",
    "- annual_income: annual income that these individuals earned as adults\n",
    "- TotalWeeksExp: Total weeks of work experience of the individual\n",
    "- gender: denotes the gender of the individual\n",
    "- minority: 1 if the individual belongs to a minority group, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- m_college: 1 if the individualâ€™s mother has a college degree, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- family income: Annual family income when these individuals were teenagers, reported in thousands.\n",
    "- gpain8: GPA in 8th grade.\n",
    "- retention: 1 if the individual was required to repeat a grade during middle school, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns of scores from the AFQT test.  The values are measured as standard deviations from the mean.  A value of '0' means the individual earned the average score.  A value of '-1' means the indivial earned a score one standard deviation below the average. \n",
    "- asvabAR: skills in arithmetic reasoning\n",
    "- asvabMK: skills in mathematical knowledge\n",
    "- asvabPC: skills in paragraph comprehension\n",
    "- asvabWK: skills in word knowledge\n",
    "- AFTQ: average of the above 4 scores \n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the questions and instructions below to complete this problem set. For some questions, please write and execute Python code for data analysis in Cell mode. Comment your code to explain each step. Some questions need text discussion. Please provide a detailed discussion of your results, including interpretations and answers to questions in Raw mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the assignment, save your Jupyter notebook with the following naming convention: ECN310_ProblemSetX_LastName_FirstName.ipynb (replace X with the assignment number)."
